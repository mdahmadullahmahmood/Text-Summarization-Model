Explanation of Each Library
streamlit â†’ For building the interactive web app.
transformers â†’ Provides BART and T5 pre-trained summarization models from Hugging Face.
bert-extractive-summarizer â†’ Enables extractive summarization using BERT.
torch â†’ Required for running deep learning models (BERT, T5, BART).
numpy â†’ Used for numerical computations.
scikit-learn â†’ Needed for data preprocessing, if required.
joblib â†’ For saving/loading models efficiently.
sentencepiece â†’ A tokenizer dependency required for T5 models.
pdfplumber â†’ An alternative PDF text extractor (if needed).
pymupdf â†’ Used to extract text from PDF files.
